# thekove
A personal blog site built with Meteor.js. No React, no Angular, and not much craziness. Just Meteor and a couple basic packages.

## Isn't it overkill?
Perhaps it is...but that's what personal projects are for, right?

## Really...Blaze?!
Why no React, Angular, or <js-framework>? I respect the efforts of those frameworks, but I'm not convinced they've really hit home with what we need for what the web is becoming. Blaze is integrated well with Meteor (for now), is easy enough to pick up, doesn't require new tooling, doesn't force weird source code mixing (staring at you, jsx), and I already knew it. That's about it.
