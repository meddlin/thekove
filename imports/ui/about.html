						I'm a software developer by trade, but my passion lies in network security. My current full-time engagements involve C#, JavaScript, and some other cool stuff in the Microsoft stack. I've also taken a liking to experimenting with web development in my free time

						I've also taken a liking to web development with Meteor.js, and have a couple ongoing projects utilizing it (like this website!).

						<p class="portfolio__description">
							"You may have 10TB of data on your target, but if you can't get to the 4KB file of password hashes it's all useless." The capstone project of my final semester at SELU--this project is designed to innovate network penetration testing by reorganizing the flat text data produced from professional tools such as nmap and recon-ng. The Meteor.js framework was chosen because of the reactive data and rapid prototyping abilities it provided.
